# Hivery
Paranuara Challenge

## Prerequisites
- virtualenv
If not installed install it using
```
pip install virtualenv 
```

- MySQL setup


## Setup
- Create a pull of the current github project.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder and initate the vitual environment
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
- Change the password in *'data.py'* and *'hivery/db.py'* to match the MySQL local database password

```
CREATE SCHEMA `hivery` ;
```

- To load the data from the JSON present in the resources folder execute the standalone python script as below

```
 python data.py 
 ```

## Development Notes

*Since the master data for separating fruits and vegetables were missing and I didnt get clarification for my mail as well, I have assumed that the master data has been missed. so I have
shortlisted the data for fruits and provided it as a list in the data load. So items which are not present in the list if 
loaded will show as vegetable in the API result*

*Fruit list provided as master data ['apple','banana','orange','strawberry']*

## Local server(w Hot reloading)

```
gunicorn --reload hivery.app

```
This should start the server at *http://localhost*

## Test Notes
We are making use of pytest to test the falcon API created.Run the test script as follows

```
pytest test 
```

/data.py - standalone python script which will load the data from the JSON to MySQL DB
